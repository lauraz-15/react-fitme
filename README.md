The project was built based on users stories. User stories are orgnised in Epics and milestones.
See the summary of the kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/lauraz-15/projects/2/views/1)
The Epics are not organised in a numbered order due to github interface, since some of the user stories(issues) were added after the firs Epic.
